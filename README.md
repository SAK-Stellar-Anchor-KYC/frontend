## 1️⃣ **1. Problem Statement**

### ❗ What real-world problem are you solving?
Stellar Anchors currently run manual, isolated and repetitive KYC/AML processes.  
Each performs verification **from scratch**, even if the user was already verified elsewhere.  
This leads to:

- Long onboarding times  
- High operational cost  
- Duplicate document uploads  
- Increased security risk  
- Poor scalability across the network  

---

### 👥 Who is affected?
- Regulated Anchors  
- Users interacting with multiple anchors  
- On/off-ramp companies  
- Platforms with compliance requirements  

---

### 🔥 Why is this urgent now?
The Stellar ecosystem is growing, and recent security incidents such as the **July 2024 Fractal ID breach** (full access to KYC documents and personal data) revealed a critical vulnerability:  
**multiple companies store full KYC copies**, multiplying the attack surface.

Because Stellar users interact with **several anchors**, this risk becomes even larger.

➡️ A unified, secure, encrypted, permission-controlled vault is needed **now**.

---

## 2️⃣ **2. Target Users & Needs**

### 🎯 Primary User
**Stellar network anchors**

### 💡 Core Need
- Reduce compliance workload  
- Remove duplicated KYC processes  
- Lower operational cost  
- Improve onboarding speed  
- Maintain full regulatory compliance  

### 🛠 Current Workaround
Each anchor runs its own isolated KYC:

- Custom forms  
- Manual verification  
- Re-uploaded documents  
- Non-reusable flows  

---

## 3️⃣ **3. Solution Overview**

### 🧠 3.1 Main Idea
**SAK** is a unified and automated KYC system with an encrypted Vault compatible with **SEP-12**.  
Users complete KYC **once**, and anchors request access via permissions.

This eliminates:
- Repeated document uploads  
- Repeated selfies  
- Manual re-verification  
- Duplicate databases that increase risk  

---

### 🧭 User Journey
1. User completes KYC once with **SAK**  
2. SAK validates documents, country and KYC level (**BASE / SEPA / AAA**)  
3. Anchor requests access  
4. User approves  
5. Anchor enables deposits, withdrawals or RWA activity  

---

### ⭐ 3.2 Why Stellar?
SAK aligns perfectly with Stellar’s anchor model:

- Uses **SEP-12**  
- Reduces compliance workload  
- Standardizes KYC flows across anchors  
- Enhances remittances, payments & RWA processes  
- Soroban smart contracts enable on-chain auditing and permission logic
